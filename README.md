# Voice, tone and style

## Voice
I can say that I have a big problem with public speaking. I'm quite an introvert. As long as I'm talking to someone I know, it's all good. I can have fun, help, listen. As soon as I have to say something to more people or give a lecture, it's a problem. At first I speak fluently, later my voice gets weaker and I start stuttering.
I try to say everything straight out to be clear. 

## Tone
I think I have a pretty deep voice and it bothers me sometimes. I don't know how to use my voice to make things sound the way I want them to. When I'm tired or angry or hiding something, my tone is always different. And that's sometimes a problem, because I let it be known right away how I'm feeling. Which sometimes I don't want to do and I like to be neutral.

## Style
My style is very laid back. When I hear someone speak in a written form, it's unnatural to me. I like to be myself. Among friends, I do occasionally use vulgar language, when it's appropriate, of course. At the same time, I'm careful not to offend anyone.
